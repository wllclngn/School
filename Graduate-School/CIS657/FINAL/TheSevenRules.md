The Seven Rules

1) Use only # style comments in Python scripts (never triple quotes)
2) Respect existing logging, username retrieval, and timestamp functions
3) Maintain error handling approaches already in the codebase
4) Present my plans before updating any file
5) Wait for your confirmation before proceeding with changes
6) If g++ or some feature in Windows, Linux, etc., can be leveraged, then utilize it over recreating the wheel.
7) NEVER include my username (wllclngn) in the actual code. I NEVER, absolutely NEVER, want to see that in my code. If you see it: Remove it!
