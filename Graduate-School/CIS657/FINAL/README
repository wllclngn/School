# XINU OS Simulation Build System

## Overview

This project provides a cross-platform build system for simulating the XINU operating system. XINU (Xinu Is Not Unix) is a small, educational operating system originally designed at Purdue University. This simulation framework allows XINU to be built and run on modern systems without requiring specialized hardware.

## Features

- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Automated generation of simulation files
- Compilation of XINU source code for simulation environments
- Runtime simulation of XINU core processes
- Support for testing starvation scenarios
- Verbose logging and build diagnostics
