CRITICAL ERROR: Circular include dependencies detected at 2025-06-18 20:27:34

Circular include path:
pstarv.h -> xinu.h -> pstarv.h

Possible solutions:
1. Use include guards in all header files (#ifndef _FILE_H_ / #define _FILE_H_)
2. Create a base_types.h file for common type definitions
3. Use forward declarations for struct types where possible
4. Reorganize your code to avoid mutual dependencies

Compilation aborted to prevent errors.
